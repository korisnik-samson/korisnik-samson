# 👋 Hi, I'm Samson - Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer & Software Engineer Extraordinaire! 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a final-year Computer Science student passionate about engineering robust, scalable backend systems and end-to-end data pipelines. My focus is on writing clean, efficient code to solve complex problems, from processing real-time data streams to building intelligent applications. I thrive on turning complex technical challenges into reliable, high-performance software.

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

🌟 Here are some of the projects I've worked on that showcase my skills as a Frontend Developer:

1. [Financial Data Pipeline](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/social): Born and raised in PySpark wombs, engineered in an end-to-end data pipeline for real-time financial collection and processing... put your money where your tech is!
2. [AI Intrusion Detection System](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/chatpdf): We've all been there, so let's cut to the chase. It's just your normal glorified antivirus with a second brain specially trained to sniff malicous threats, have fun 💫🌠✨
3. [Brain Tumour Segmentation Research](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/income-predictor): Since most people (especially neurologists and radiologists) make sublte mistakes in manually delineating brain tumours from scans, we gave them a helping hand... Don't worry we can't cure you either ❤️
4. [Formula One Data Pipeline](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/car-octo-system): We got data hungry, so Formula One data gave us what we needed for a meal. P.S It was sumptuous
5. [Denver Music App](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/denver): Who needs Spotify, when you've got Denver from your boy Sam :)
6. [Console Chess](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/console-chess-sans): We don't really give a rat's ass about real chess when it can be played on a computer?!
7. [Trip Guides](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/travel-booking): With my app, it's impossible to get lost... I want you to try as hard as you can... You'll never get lost 😈
8. [Generic Binary Trees](https://github.com/samson-offorjindu/Generic-Binary-Tree): Some algorithm in Java... but on steroids 💫🌠✨

💼 I currently work at a university... who would've thought huh...

## 📚 Schooling

🎓 Currently, I'm a bachelor's degree holder thanks to [Singidunum University](https://singidunum.ac.rs), where I'm *still* honing my Software & Data Engineering skills and continuously expanding my knowledge.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, want to collaborate on a project, or just want to chat about research, machine learning or web dev and design. I'm always up for a good conversation!
