# 👋 Hello, I'm Samson - Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer & Frontend Developer Extraordinaire! 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about crafting beautiful, user-friendly web experiences that make the digital world come to life. With a keen eye for design and a love for clean, efficient code, I'm dedicated to making the web a better place, one line of code at a time.

## 🛠️ Projects & Portfolio

🌟 Here are some of the projects I've worked on that showcase my skills as a Frontend Developer:

1. [Socail Media App](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/social): Here it's basically me trying to make a combination of Threads, Instagram, and Snapchat... in one app... kao šećer, žacin i sve lepo 💀
2. [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/income-predictor): Since most people within the working class are broke, this will predict if you can make $50,000/yr
3. [Car Rental System](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/car-octo-system): People can't afford cars today, so they rent them... Rent yours from my website, it's cheap asf!
4. [Denver Music App](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/denver): Who needs Spotify, when you've got Denver from your boy Sam :)
5. [Console Chess](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/console-chess-sans): We don't really give a rat's ass about real chess when it can be played on a computer?!
6. [Trip Guides](https://github.com/korisnik-samson/travel-booking): With my app, it's impossible to get lost... I want you to try as hard as you can... You'll never get lost 😈
7. [Generic Binary Trees](https://github.com/samson-offorjindu/Generic-Binary-Tree): Some algorithm in Java... but on crack 💫🌠✨
